# Thin-Airfoil-Theory-DVM

The solver to derive the solution to thin airfoil problem is based on the discrete vortex method. The solverâ€™s discrete vortex method uses lumped-vortex elements to provide an approximate solution to the fundamental equation derived from thin airfoil theory i.e., integral equation for vortex distribution.
