# Thin-Airfoil-Theory-DVM

This repository presents the solver used to solve the thin airfoil problem programmed in MATLAB. The solver to derive the solution to the thin airfoil problem is based on the discrete vortex method. The solverâ€™s discrete vortex method uses lumped-vortex elements to provide an approximate solution to the fundamental equation derived from thin airfoil theory i.e., the integral equation for vortex distribution.

The following flowchart shows the working of the solver-

The detailed documentation and working of the solver with key equations are presented in [Git-Thin-Airfoil-Theory-DVM.pdf](https://github.com/Daamanbarara/Thin-Airfoil-Theory-DVM/blob/2ca6a1db197a41af26630c3eecf65e15048b81af/Git-Thin-Airfoil-Theory-DVM.pdf).
